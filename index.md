  **Best SCRUM Master to ever live.**  After spending ten years leading and training highly technical warfighters onboard submarines, I transitioned to civilian life where I lead and train highly technical desk jokeys in SCRUM practices to support the mission and deliver software ahead of schedule.

## Aloha World

I am responsible for developing and implementing Agile methodologies to enhance team productivity and project success. By facilitating daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives, I ensure team alignment and progress, driving an increase in efficiency. I guide the team in adhering to Agile principles, removing impediments, and promoting self-organization, resulting in reduction in project delivery time. Acting as a liaison between the development team, stakeholders, and clients, I ensure clear communication and alignment on project goals and timelines, leading to improvement in client satisfaction scores. I streamline workflows and foster a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging innovation and process refinement. My efforts significantly contribute to the successful delivery of high-impact software applications and the overall operational excellence of the organization.
